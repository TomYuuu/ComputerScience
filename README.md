When we open the site, we can see the distribution of all Chicago neighborhoods as well as the markers that represent schools, fire stations, police stations and hospitals. On the left side of the site, we can select a neighborhood or search to find the one we want to see.

After selecting the neighborhood you want to see, you can see the charts for that neighborhood, which represent information on population, education, employment, and so on.
